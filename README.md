## ML-RUN
A small repository where I work on data science and machine learning mini-project. Think of this as a place where I come to learn and also have fun while learning.

Want to join me in learning and having fun? Then you can follow the simple steps below to get you started. I've made provision for `conda` and `pip` users.

To create you environment using `conda` you can go ahead and run the following commands; making sure that conda is installed on your machine first.
```bash
$ conda create --prefix ./env --file requirements.txt
```

To create you environment using `pip` you can go ahead and run the following commands; making sure that `pip` is installed on your machine first.
```bash
$ pip install -r ./pip/requirements.txt
```
